[KNOWN ISSUES]

1. Core Functionality

   - Need better error recovery in action execution
   - Need improved state validation between transitions
   - Memory management needs optimization for long sessions
   - Graph execution flow needs monitoring for long-running tasks
   - Need to implement proper session cleanup on completion

2. Technical Debt
   - Remove redundant state tracking
   - Standardize error handling across components
   - Improve logging consistency
   - Clean up deprecated code paths
   - Convert AgentState fields to Pydantic models:
     - Convert brain state to BrainState model
     - Convert task_analysis to TaskAnalysis model
     - Convert context to ContextState model
     - Convert messages to Message model
     - Convert tools_used to Tool model
     - Ensure all state fields use proper Pydantic models

[SOLVED ISSUES]

- Fixed duplicate state updates in UI
- Implemented graceful completion handling
- Centralized completion state management
- Added user-friendly completion messages
- Streamlined state propagation through graph

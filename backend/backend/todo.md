[KNOWN ISSUES]

1. Core Functionality

   - Need better error recovery in action execution
   - Need improved state validation between transitions
   - Memory management needs optimization for long sessions
   - Need better completion detection logic

2. Technical Debt
   - Remove redundant state tracking
   - Standardize error handling across components
   - Improve logging consistency
   - Clean up deprecated code paths
